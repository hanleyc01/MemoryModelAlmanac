# MemoryModelAlmanac


<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

In this website, we will be compiling all extant memory models in
cognitive science. This project aims to be useful for someone new to the
field of cognitive modeling of human memory, however the main purpose is
for me to gain an encyclopedic knowledge of the different memory models
which are historically relevant.
